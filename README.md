# N-Back Game

N-Back Game is a simple game of improving memory.
This game is super easy. This program will show a just one random number
sequentially and periodically on the screen. All you can do is memorizing
N sequencial numbers and check the current number matches to N's back number.
If it does, type 'v' otherwise, nothing  to do.

This program inputs two numbers, one is the number 'N' and the other is 'T' that is total number of being showed.
Ofcourse, T must be greater than N.
Enjoy the game! Thanks

# TODO

* I think it would be great to be able to change the speed of printing numbers.
