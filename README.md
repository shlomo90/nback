# N-Back Game

N-Back Game is a simple game to improve your brain.

# How to play?

Run the command below

```python start.py```

First, when you run this program, it requires a 'N' number (You can choose 1 ~ 100) and 'T' total number of requests.
(Notes: 'T' must be greater than 'N'.) After Setting up 'N' and 'T', the main game starts!

A random number comes up on the screen every two second until the count of shown numbers meets 'T'.
You should memorize the numbers that are from current number to N steps back.
If current number and N steps back number are the same, you have to input "Left Allow (<-)".
or It's not, you have to input "Right Allow (->)". Don't be late to press buttons.

The result of the game shows up after the last number shows.
You can check your scores. Enjoy the game. Thanks.

* I think it would be great to be able to change the speed of printing numbers.
